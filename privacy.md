# Privacy Policy for SyncZen (ScamGuard)

**Last Updated: February 2026**

SyncZen is committed to protecting user privacy. This policy outlines our handling of data:

1. **Data Collection**: The extension reads the text content of the active browser tab only when the user explicitly triggers a "Security Scan."
2. **Data Usage**: Collected text is sent to our secure backend to be analyzed by AI for fraudulent patterns (social engineering, ClickFix, etc.).
3. **Data Retention**: We do not store, sell, or trade your browsing history or the text content analyzed. Data is processed in real-time and discarded after the session.
4. **Third Parties**: Analysis is performed using Groq's API. No personally identifiable information (PII) is intentionally shared with third parties.
5. **Permissions**: The 'activeTab' and 'scripting' permissions are used solely to perform on-demand security analysis at the user's request.
